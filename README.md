# Dream Catcher
Dream Catcher is a full-stack project that leverages machine learning models to generate images based on a dream's description.

The project uses a frontend developed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and Ant Design and a backend developed with FastAPI. Images are generated by a Python script that integrates a pre-trained machine learning model.
